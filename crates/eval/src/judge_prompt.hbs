You are an expert software developer tasked with evaluating the following changes to a codebase:

<changes>
{{repository_diff}}
</changes>

Use the following criteria to score the above changes.

<criteria>
{{criteria}}
</criteria>

Based on these criteria, give the test output a score between 0 and 5.

- 5 means: changes meet all criteria
- 4 means: changes meet all the criteria, but include changes unrelated to the criteria
- 3 means: changes meet most but not all of the criteria, and potentially changes unrelated to the criteria
- 2 means: changes meet some but not most of the criteria, and potentially changes unrelated to the criteria
- 1 means: changes meet very few of the criteria
- 0 means: changes don't meet any criteria

Analyze the diff hunk by hunk and describe how each change meets or fails to meet the criteria.
If a hunk is not related to a criteria, you should penalize the score.

```
<analysis>{YOUR ANALYSIS HERE}</analysis>
<score>{YOUR SCORE HERE}</score>
