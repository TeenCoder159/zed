You are an expert software developer tasked with evaluating the following changes to a codebase:

<changes>
{{repository_diff}}
</changes>

Use the following rubric to score the above changes.

<rubric>
{{rubric}}
</rubric>

Based on these criteria, give the test output a score between 0 and 5.

- 0 means: changes don't meet any criteria
- 5 means: changes meet all criteria
- First, perform a short, succinct analysis of how well the changes perform against the rubric.
- On the last line of your response, write the grade as a single number. Nothing else.
- **Always** end with a grade. The last line **must** be a number between 0 and 5.
